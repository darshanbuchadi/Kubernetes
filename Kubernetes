In Kubernetes, "Kind" stands for Kubernetes in Docker. It's a tool designed to run local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container "nodes." 
Kind was primarily developed to facilitate testing Kubernetes itself, but it's also useful for local development and experimentation with Kubernetes configurations.
With Kind, you can quickly spin up lightweight Kubernetes clusters on your local machine, 
which is particularly helpful for testing applications or trying out new Kubernetes features without needing a full-scale production environment.

To create kind cluster command line is ----- kind create cluster --name  darshan --config=name of the yaml file 

to see the cluster ------- kubectl get nodes
to delete the cluster -------- kind delete cluster --name=darshn 

Once we delete the cluster here "the kube config" still points to our deleted cluster so hence we use this command also guve all the cluster associated with your kube config----- kubectl config view 

---------Kubectll use-context nameofcluster  ----to switch the context 
----eg---Kubectll use-context kind-multi

kubectl config use-context kind-multi ---- to switch between clusters
